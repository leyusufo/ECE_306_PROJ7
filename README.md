 This project consists of a car that travels around a circle made from a black electrical tape.
 The car can travel around the circle by detecting where the back electrical tape is and following the trajectory of the black tape.
 The car uses a light sensor to detect the black tape which is located in between its front wheels.
 The source files for this project can be found in the source_files directory.
